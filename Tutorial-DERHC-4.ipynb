    "### Objectives \n",
    "The objectives of this tutorial are:\n",
    "1. To familiarise with the process by which power engineers can carry out **Monte Carlo-based time-series analyses and determine the PV Hosting Capacity of a given MV-LV (22kV-0.4kV) distribution network considering uncertainties due to customer demand, customer phase connection, PV generation, and PV location.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To continue familiarising with the advanced tool [OpenDSS](https://www.epri.com/pages/sa/opendss) (using Python and the [dss_python](https://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_python) module). And, to guide you, all will be done using a notebook on [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of this Notebook\n",
    "The rest of this notebook is divided into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2. Tutorial.** \n",
    "     - You will learn, step by step, how to allocate time-varying **Load and PV profiles** to a given integrated MV-LV (22kV-0.4kV) network with many customers at once. These profiles enable the **time-series analysis** necessary to observe how values (for instance, customer voltages) vary throughout the whole day due to PV (or any other technology).  \n",
    "     - You will learn how to perform PV Hosting Capacity studies using Monte Carlo-based time-series analyses of the integrated MV-LV network.\n",
    "- **3. Exercises.** Here you will go through some exercises that will help you familiarise with the code and how to modify it for different purposes.\n",
    "- **4. Simulation Workspace.** Here you can place all your code to run it at once. You should use **`code`** that is relevant to each exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>**<u>Note</u>:**</font> Make sure to understand well how to model the network, particularly how to allocate PV systems and change PV penetrations (2. Tutorial) as this is crucial to go through the exercises. If you make a mistake when modelling the network, your results will be incorrect."

    "## 2. Tutorial \n",
    "### 2.1 Test Feeder and Considerations\n",
    "The test Medium Voltage (MV) feeder (also known as High Voltage [HV] feeder as it depends on how MV and HV are defined in a country) used in this tutorial is a real, three-phase MV feeder from Victoria, Australia, owned and operated by **[AusNet Services](https://www.ausnetservices.com.au/)**, who is one of the distribution companies (known as Distribution Network Service Providers [DNSPs] in Australia) in the State of Victoria, Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time-series active power values of residential load and PV generation used in this tutorial correspond to real, anonymised measurements from smart meters and dedicated PV generation meters that were also provided by **[AusNet Services](https://www.ausnetservices.com.au/)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The MV feeder is one of multiple feeders supplied by a 2x33 MVA, Delta-Wye 66kV/22kV primary substation. The topology is shown in **Figure 1** where the black triangle is the primary substation and the distribution transformers are shown as circles. Their transformer rated capacities are illustrated with the colour map.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The test MV feeder is a real 22kV feeder with 79 distribution transformers, 70 with single-phase residential customers (and corresponding three-phase 400V LV networks) and 9 with three-phase commercial customers (aggregated and directly connected to the transformer, no LV networks). In total, there are 3,374 single-phase residential customers and 9 three-phase commercial customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All the distribution transformers have a transformation ratio of 22kV/0.433kV. Note that although the nominal voltage of the LV networks is 400V (line-to-line), the transformer is actually having a transformation ratio that *boosts* the voltage on the secondary (around 8%). This *boost* is common practice in Australia, in the UK, and other countries around the world. Off-load tap changers are also common and can be used to tune the transformation ratio as needed (+5%, +2.5%, 0, -2.5%, -5%).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The residential load dataset contains a pool of 342 daily real profiles (342 customers) for a whole year (365 days) in 30-minute intervals. In this particular case, it contains only active power (kW). Consequently, in this tutorial we will be creating the associated reactive power (kvar) profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The residential PV generation dataset contains daily real profiles (normalised from 0 to 1) for a whole year (365 days) in 30-minute intervals. Given that the sun shines simultaneously to everyone in a small area (such as an LV circuit), for the day being investigated, only one PV generation profile is selected and applied to all the PV systems. However, the actual PV generation depends on the size of each of the PV systems (and any PV inverter function being used).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The idea behind the **Monte Carlo assessment** is to capture uncertainties by running multiple possible cases (different demand profiles, different locations of DER, etc.) to then have a spectrum of potential effects (e.g., voltage compliance issues, asset congestion issues, etc.) for a specific day and PV penetration. Therefore, once a specific day (or set of days) is defined (e.g., the month of January - which is summer in Australia), the code randomly allocates residential demand profiles to customers and does so for each of the Monte Carlo runs (e.g., 100 runs means 100 possible cases). Commercial demand profiles remain fixed. And once a PV penetration is defined (percentage of customers with a PV system), the code randomly allocates PV systems to customers (randomising not only location but also the size of the PV system). Nonetheless, we use a `seed` to keep the same random allocation of demand and PV profiles for different PV penetrations so there is a progressive adoption of PV systems (i.e., each PV penetration builds on the previous one).\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>**<u>Note 1</u>:**</font> Because of the random allocation of demand profiles, some residential customers might be allocated profiles that have large demand. Since some transformers are small and others have many customers, it is worth checking that the base case (no PV) does not have any transformer issues. If that happens, adapt the code or run another allocation. Given that these are Hosting Capacity studies, if possible, it is best to start from a point where the network has no issues. This avoids confusion with existing and DER-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>**<u>Note 2</u>:**</font> The LV networks are pseudo LV networks. They have been created based on the number of customers per transformer and modern design principles used in Australia. However, this also means that the LV impedances are small (larger conductors are used today). Because of these small impedances, **the adopted PV systems are large (with up to 8 kVA inverters). This is simply to demonstrate voltage rise issues**. However, in Australia, it is common for distribution companies to impose a 5kW export limit to single-phase customers. In practice, this means that most installations have inverters of up to 5kVA."

    "<font color='red'>**<u>Note</u>:**</font> These results are not idea because only 2 runs (`Num_Run = 2`) is not sufficient for a proper Monte Carlo assessment. This small number was used so this demonstration is quick. Nonetheless, the DOC file [Results_for_different runs](Results_for_different_runs.docx) shows the results for **10, 30, 100 and 200** runs. The number of runs is a key factor to have comprehensive results when doing a Monte Carlo assessment."
