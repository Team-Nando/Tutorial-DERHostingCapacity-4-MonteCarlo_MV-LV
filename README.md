# Tutorial on DER Hosting Capacity - Part 4: Monte Carlo Assessment of PV Hosting Capacity of an Integrated MV-LV Network

## Tutorial on DER Hosting Capacity

This multi-part Tutorial on Distributed Energy Resource (DER) Hosting Capacity will guide you, using interactive code via Jupyter Notebook and Python, through the different steps to run advanced, detailed time-series simulations to properly assess the technical impacts of DERs (such as solar photovoltaics ☀️🏡) on realistic three-phase unbalanced distribution networks.

This Tutorial is designed for power engineering students (undergraduate and postgraduate), power engineers, researchers, consultants, etc. It requires some knowledge of coding (of course! 🤓) but not too advanced. If you are a decent coder, you will manage 😉.

## Part 4: Monte Carlo Assessment of PV Hosting Capacity of an Integrated MV-LV Network

The objectives of this tutorial are:
1. To familiarise with the process by which power engineers can carry out **Monte Carlo-based time-series analyses and determine the PV Hosting Capacity of a given MV-LV distribution network** considering uncertainties due to customer demand, customer phase connection, PV generation, and PV location.
2. To continue familiarising with **advanced tools** useful to run distribution network studies involving DERs. You will continue using [OpenDSS](https://www.epri.com/pages/sa/opendss) via the [dss_python](https://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_python) module. And, to guide you, all will be done using a notebook on [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

### Pre-Requisites for Part 4
- You should have completed [Part 1](https://github.com/Team-Nando/Tutorial-DERHostingCapacity-1-AdvancedTools_LV), [Part 2](https://github.com/Team-Nando/Tutorial-DERHostingCapacity-2-TimeSeries_LV) and [Part 3](https://github.com/Team-Nando/Tutorial-DERHostingCapacity-3-VoltWatt_LV).
- For this part you just need Python (Anaconda) and the dss_python module. OpenDSS was only needed in Part 0 for demonstration purposes.

## Run Part 4
Make sure you have installed Anaconda, the dss_python module, etc. as specified in [Part 0](https://github.com/Team-Nando/Tutorial-DERHostingCapacity-0-dss_python). Otherwise, you will not be able to go through the tutorial. To guarantee that you have all the necessary packages you can also run the  **`requirements.txt`** file using  **`pip install -r requirements.txt`** on the Anaconda prompt.

1. Download all the files using the green **`<> Code`** button at the top right.
   - You will get a ZIP file with a folder that contains all the files.
   - Unzip the file an place the folder somewhere in your computer/laptop.
3. To open the Jupyter notebook file (extension **`ipynb`**) you need to:
   - Open Anaconda Navigator
   - Click on Launch Jupyter notebook (it will open in your browser)
   - Upload the unzipped folder (with all the corresponding files) to Jupyter Notebook (the location is up to you)
   - Go inside the folder and open the **`ipynb`** file

All the tutorial instructions will be in the **`ipynb`** file.

Enjoy! 🤓
